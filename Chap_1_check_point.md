#### 1.2 What Is A Computer?
##### 1.2.1 what are hardware and software?  
	Hardare is components you can physically see,such as the monitor.  
	Software is invisible.Such as a program.Softwares controls the hardware.  
  
##### 1.2.2 List the five major hardware components of a computer.  
	monitor,keyboard,mouse,harddisk,  
	correction: input devices, output devices, storage devices, memory , CPU  
	one more : communication devices  
  
##### 1.2.3 what does the acronym CPU stand for? What unit is used to measure CPU speed?  
	CPU stands for Central Processing Unit.  
	Hertz is the measurement of CPU speed.  
   
##### 1.2.4 what is a bit? what is a byte?    
	A bit is a digit in the binary number system.  
	A byte is the mininum storage unit in a computer.  

##### 1.2.5 what is memory for? what does RAM stand for? Why is memory called RAM?  
	memory is a place where the CPU can execute programs and datas.  
	RAM stands for Random-Access Memory.  
	Because data in memory can be read and retriev randomly  

##### 1.2.6 what unit is used to measure memory size? what unit is used to measure disk size?  
	KB  
	GB  

##### 1.2.7 what is the primary difference between memory and a storage device?
	The memory is a volatile form of storage .Once the power is turned off,data saved in memory will lost whilt data in storage devices won't. Programs and datas can be saved in  storage devices permanently.

#### 1.3  Programming Languages
##### 1.3.1 what language does the CPU understand ?  
	machine language.   

##### 1.3.2 what is an assenmbly language? what is an assembler?  
	Assembly language uses short discriptive word ,called mnemonic, to represent machine-language instructions.  
	Computers don't understand assembly language. An assembler is a tool that can translate assembly-languages program into machine code.  

##### 1.3.3 what is a high-level programming language? what is a source program?  
    A high-level language is similar to Englishã€‚It's platform independent.One can write a program in high-level language and run the program on different machines.
    A program written in high-level language is called a source program.
##### 1.3.4 what is an interpreter? what is a compiler?  
    An interpreter translates one statement from source code into machine code or virtual machine code,and executes it right away.
    A compiler translates the whole source program into a machine code file. and then the file is exectuted.
##### 1.3.5 what is the difference between an interpreted language and a compiled language?  
    I don't know.

#### 1.4 Operating Systems
